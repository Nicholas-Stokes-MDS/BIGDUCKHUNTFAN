How to play:
use the buttons on the troop panel to place your troops. once everybody has placed their troops, click on a troop to move them. Once each troop has been moved or the end turn button has been pressed, troops will all take turns dealing damage to each other. If a troop is adjacent to another troop, those troops will give each other plus one damage (non stackable). Strategically move your troops to defeat all the opponent troops. 

If player one has just moved, they will attack first and vice versa.

Troop stats can be found in the "troops" file.
